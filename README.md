# MM_Publisher: Houdini Asset Publishing Tool

## Overview

I'm developing a comprehensive asset publishing tool within Houdini designed to streamline your export workflow. It enables direct export of FBX, VDB, and ABC files, complete with an organized working folder and version control system. Additionally, the tool offers integrated flipbook generation and direct publishing to Flow Production with a single click.
